# scripts
The objective of this project is to have a collection of scripts in varius language in order to 
- have them ready, when we need them.
- Learn scripting.
- Learn software development through scripting ( and later programming ) gradually.

The scripts here have lots of comments to explain the code. In this way we can learn the language directly from the scripts.
also the index of the scripts will have them listed in order of complexity, so that newbees will have ease of understanding.

All the best.
